Text-Based Horror Game
Role: Lead Developer | Team Size: 7 | Tools: Agile, Scrum, Jira, C++, Visual Studio

BTS Mansion Game is a text-based horror game developed as part of a collaborative student project, emphasizing Agile software development and team-based programming. My primary role was Lead Developer, where I designed and implemented the architecture for the main classes, ensuring scalability and modularity. I collaborated with other developers during team meetings to refine the code and align our technical decisions with project goals of the team.

Additionally, I supported the Scrum Master by assisting with sprint planning, backlog grooming, and other responsibilities as needed. Our team employed Jira and Kanban boards to efficiently manage tasks, track progress and story points, and divide work equally.

Summary of Activities:

- Agile & Scrum Practices: Participated in daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives, presenting progress and addressing blockers effectively.

- Team Collaboration: Conducted code reviews, addressed technical challenges, and contributed to creating retrospectives for sprint improvement.

- Stakeholder Engagement: Presented project updates and retrospectives to "stakeholders" (course professor), simulating real-world software development workflows.

- Technical Skills: Gained hands-on experience in software design, version control, and collaborative coding practices.

This project taught me so much of Agile methodologies, while simultaneously honing my teamwork, coding, and problem solving skills in a dynamic team environment.
This was the most fun course during my time at college and defenitely learned the most during this project, especially about what it means to work in a team.


Description of the game:
You go on a camping trip with your best friend, only to be knocked out, waking up inside this creepy mansion. You must navigate the mansion, collecting all 5 candles to complete a ritual and banish the evil entity chasing you around. Why are you here, what is behind all of this, and how are you going to survive, only time will tell.

**INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE GAME**
1. Open the code via visual studio
2. Run the main .cpp file, (You may need to clean the solution if it doesn't work the first time)
3. Enjoy the game!

**Note**
This repository is not the original repo of the project, it is a private repo, therefore I couldn't share the repo publicly, if you wish to see the 300 commits throughout the project or anything
